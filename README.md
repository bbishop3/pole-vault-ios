iOS pole vault journal app
This is my senior project for Samford University. The goal of this app is to create an iOS applicaton that acts as a "pole vault journal". It will be able to document certain elements of a practice such as what pole was used, step, grip, bungee, etc. I have sent out a google form to ask other pole vaulters and pole vault coaches what kind of different features they would like to see in an app such as this. Based on the feedback, I would like to add an imperial -> metric converter, a graph that charts height progress over a season, a printable pdf of the app's data, and a photo/video gallery. So far, it seems like there are only three pole vault journal type apps currently on the app store. This app will hopefully aid pole vaulters by having an application that will store all of their important marks, allow for coaching opportunities, and help give vaulters a visual representation of their preformance throughout each season. Ultimately, I would like for this app to be on the app store, and I would like it to be free to download.
